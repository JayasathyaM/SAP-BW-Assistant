## Example Task Implementation

### TASK ID: P1_01_DATABASE_SCHEMA
### PHASE: 1 - Foundation
### PRIORITY: High
### ESTIMATED TIME: 2 hours
### DEPENDENCIES: None
### DELIVERABLE: PostgreSQL schema with all SAP BW tables

### Task Definition
```
OBJECTIVE:
Create complete PostgreSQL database schema for SAP BW process chain tables with proper relationships and constraints.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [ ] All 4 tables created (RSPCLOGCHAIN, RSPCCHAIN, RSPCPROCESSLOG, RSPCVARIANT)
- [ ] Foreign key relationships established
- [ ] Data types properly mapped
- [ ] Schema can be executed without errors

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- PostgreSQL 12+ compatible
- Proper indexing for performance
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- Column names match SAP BW exactly

VALIDATION STEPS:
1. Execute schema script without errors
2. Verify all tables exist with correct structure
3. Test foreign key constraints
4. Confirm data types are appropriate
```

### Implementation Section
```
FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY:
- database/schema.sql
- database/db_manager.py
- config/database_config.py

COMMANDS TO RUN:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d sap_bw -f database/schema.sql
python database/db_manager.py --test-connection
```

TESTING APPROACH:
- Schema execution test
- Foreign key constraint test
- Data type validation test
```

### Documentation Requirements
```
CODE COMMENTS:
- Document each table purpose
- Explain foreign key relationships
- Note any SAP BW specific considerations

README UPDATES:
- Database setup instructions
- PostgreSQL installation guide

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Connection issues
- Permission problems
- Schema conflicts
```
